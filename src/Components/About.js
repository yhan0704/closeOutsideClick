        <p>
          I hold an Associate’s Degree in Computer Science and recently
          graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a
          Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Systems. From there I
          attended Flatiron School where I honed my skills as a developer.
          During FlatIron School’s 15-Week Intensive Software Engineering
          Program, I’ve built web applications using Redux, React, Ruby, and
          Ruby on Rails programming.

          I am passionate about coding because of my drive to solve problems and
          create a final product. Beyond my academic qualifications, I continue
          to advance my skills as a developer by enhancing projects within my
          portfolio and preparing for the AWS practitioner certification. I
          welcome you to take a look at my portfolio and please contact me with
          any questions you may have.
